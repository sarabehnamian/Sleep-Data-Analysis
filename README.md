# Sleep-Data-Analysis
This project demonstrates my programming skills and ability to work with sleep data using Python. The project involves processing and visualizing a publicly available sleep dataset from PhysioNet (Goldberger et al., 2000). The dataset used is the Sleep-EDF dataset, which contains EEG, EOG, and EMG signals recorded during sleep studies.
# Dataset
The Sleep-EDF dataset was recorded in the early 1990s and contains over 150 sleep recordings from more than 80 individuals. Each recording includes 22 channels of data, including EEG, EOG, EMG, and other signals. The data was collected at several European sleep centers and was made available through the PhysioNet database.

# Code
The Python script loads the Sleep-EDF dataset using the MNE-Python library (Gramfort et al., 2013). It then preprocesses the data, including filtering the signals to remove noise and artifacts. A 30-second epoch of the sleep data is then extracted and plotted using matplotlib.

The code showcases my technical skills and expertise in handling sleep data, which can be beneficial for future projects in the field of sleep research.
